# FightClub
FightClub app was created as an internship task for Lunar Logic.
The goal was to create an application where user is the owner of the Fight Club.
The basic requirements were that the user should be able to:

1. Add new fighters,
2. See the list of fighters,
3. Add fights by selecting 2 previously added fighters.

Additionally, I implemented an option to remove fighters, see the best fighter and the latest winner.

I decided to use only javascript and jQuery, and also html5 and css3. 
I used gulp and bower to manage packages. 

## Running the app
This app requires you to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org), [bower](http://bower.io/) and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed on your computer. To preview it, please run the following commands in main directory:

1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ bower install`
3. `$ gulp serve`

This will install all of the needed dependencies, run an app on local server and open it in your default browser.
